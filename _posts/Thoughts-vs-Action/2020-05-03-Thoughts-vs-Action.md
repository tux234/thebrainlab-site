As I'm going through learning more about Stoicism, the thing that I see come up repeatedly is that we are supposed to be people of action, and not just words. This statement is what is so refreshing about Stoicism. It forces you to act, not just think. Look at the words of Epictetus:

> “First tell yourself what kind of person you want to be, then do what you have to do. For in nearly every pursuit we see this to be the case. Those in athletic pursuit first choose the sport they want, and then do that work.” —**Epictetus, Discourses, 3.23.1–2a**

Once you figure out the type of person that you want to be, then it's your job to do it, not just think about doing it. This brings another thought in mind from the book [Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones](https://amzn.to/2W0Ju7k) by James Clear. 

> “The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.” ― **James Clear**

The best way to action, is by taking on the identity of who you want to be. If you want to be healthy and fit, take on the identity of a fit person. When you wake up in the morning say to yourself, __"I am a someone who is healthy and fit, and I will make choices today that represent that"__. 

This greatly increases your chances at becoming who you want to be. This is one of the greatest pieces of wisdom I learned. Now get to it!
