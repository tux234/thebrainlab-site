I have developed a morning ritual in which I read [The Daily Stoic Journal](https://amzn.to/2S9C3YZ) and then write my thoughts down. Today's reading was really thought provoking, the gist was is that nice cars, jewels, the finer things in life, should sometimes be looked on with a critical eye, and allow us to realize what they are. ***Stuff***.

All of the things we lust after are temporary, and fleeting at best. How much better is it to look at building and accumulating virtues, such as patience, reasoning, and temperance. The desire of stuff like this is fleeting and will corrupt our souls. We should all desire and be content with the simple. Today, we are alive. That's enough. All else is blessings to be thankful for.
